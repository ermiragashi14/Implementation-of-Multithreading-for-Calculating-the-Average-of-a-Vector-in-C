Multithreading-Based Vector Average Calculation in C

This project focuses on implementing a multithreaded application in C that calculates the average of a predefined vector using POSIX threads (pthreads). 
The goal is to demonstrate the advantages of parallel processing in optimizing performance, managing concurrency, and improving resource utilization in
modern multi-core systems.
